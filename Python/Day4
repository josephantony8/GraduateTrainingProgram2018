1.You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.
alison heck => Alison Heck
Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

  full_name=raw_input("Enter the string")
  capitalized_name=[]
  name_list=full_name.split(' ')
  if len(full_name)<1000:
	  for i in name_list:
		  firstchar=i[0:]
		  if firstchar.isalpha()==True:
			  capitalized_name.append(i.title())
		  else:
			  capitalized_name.append(i)
	  full_name_capitalized=' '.join(capitalized_name)
	  print(full_name_capitalized)
  else:
	  print("String is exceeding the length")
    
    
2.You have a record of  students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer  followed by the names and marks for students.
You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

  stu_count=int(raw_input("Enter the no of students"))
  stu_dic={}
  for i in range(stu_count) :
	  marks =[]
	  name_marks=raw_input("Enter the student name and marks")
	  detail_list=name_marks.split(' ')
	  name=detail_list[0]
	  for j in range(len(detail_list)-1):
		  marks.append(int(detail_list[j+1]))
	  stu_dic[name]=marks
 print(stu_dic)
 stu_name=raw_input("Enter the name")
 average=sum(stu_dic[stu_name])/len(stu_dic[stu_name])
 print(float(average))
 
 
 3.Task:-
   You are given two values a and b . 
   Perform integer division and print a/b .

  Input Format:-
  The first line contains T , the number of test cases. 
  The next T lines each contain the space separated values of a and b .

  Constraints:-
  * 0 < T < 10

  Output Format
  Print the value of . 
  In the case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code.
  
  
  def div(number1,number2):
	try:
		result=int(number1)/int(number2)
		print(int(result))
	except Exception as error:
		print(error)
 test_case=int(raw_input("Enter the number of test cases"))
 for i in range(test_case):
	 number1=raw_input("Enter first value")
	 number2=raw_input("Enter second value")
	 div(number1,number2)
